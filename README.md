gtk2-refresh - Apply .gtkrc-2.0 changes immediately
===================================================

Very simple program that asks all GTK 2 windows to reload the configuration file. Helpful if you want to edit your
.gtkrc-2.0 by hand and quickly test the result on already opened GTK 2 applications.

Needs `libgtk2.0-dev`, then run `make`, and `./gtk2-refresh`
